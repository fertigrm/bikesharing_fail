Based on this data we can see that the heaviest activity is from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, we can also see the lowest activity hours are from around 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM, with these we can assume that the most ideal time for maintenance is during this early AM window to be able to keep up with the demand for the day.

Below is a heatmap showing the trips by gender and status with the platform(subscriber or customer) during the week

# Summary
This analysis providing us with a multitude of data, a big takeaway from the data shows a very high level of activity during the month of August in the year 2019, with a majority of the rides taking place in Manhattan. The data also shows us a more male heavy userload during most hours of the day.
- Food for thought:
- Including weather data to see how that determines rider use
- Analyze more months
